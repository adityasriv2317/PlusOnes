## 01 – Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery

The use of AI in Front-End development can definitely help in completing the project faster and hence let there be room for focusing on other sections of a product such as security, data processing and handling and app optimization. AI can also be useful in generating a standard and structured design and layout for an app, which obviously will be very generic. Therefore we must not rely completely on AI but contribute our own creativity to the project as well.
Therefore what my approach for making an remains to leverage AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for verifying and speeding the process of structure and getting a template design that i can modify according to my needs.

## 02 – Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students

- Unfortunately the current approach of most of the students has been to use ChatGPT, Google Lens or even any other tool to complete their homeworks and cheat in exams. This shall not be endorsed as it limits the thinking capabilities and creates a fear of attempting on their own; which are very important aspects that drive a person to learn a new skill or to understand a new concept.
- The correct way is to reform learning for students by making the process incentive based; which is mostly used by the social media platforms and our education system still relies on punishments and rules that can be surpassed easily.
- A better AI learning platform in my opinion will be the one that provides students with a connected social media like experience with various incentives for achievements, passing quizzes and even for learning small concepts.
- Some students are not a fast learners, therefore the AI part shall be able to identify those students and reform the lessons and assignments for them in order to help them in be more competant and learn better.
- The platform shall also help educators in making the modules more visual and appealing to students
